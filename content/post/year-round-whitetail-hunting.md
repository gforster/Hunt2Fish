Hey everybody, I just wanted to write a quick, short article to keep you motivated about deer hunting. This time of year it is easy to think about everything else. There is ice fishing, small game hunting, turkey season is right around the corner and of course we are all gearing up for open water. There is plenty to do this time of year in regards to deer hunting though - the hunt should never stop. Now is a great time of year to scout new areas especially if there is no snow. Last years'
rubs, scrapes, deer runs, and possible bedding areas are still visible. If you are looking to scout new areas, this is the prime time because most hunters on public land leave lots of evidence they were there and you can eliminate ground quickly. Studying maps is one of my favorite things to do this time of year as well. Satellite maps and contour maps can really be a help if you know what to look for. If you have private ground, now is the time to start making that to do list and thinking
about improvements to be made over the summer. I like to go through and fix my shooting lanes in late winter, it will be similar to what the woods are going to look like come fall. Personally, I plan on making a new bow spot with a ground blind in the thickest cover on the property and expand my food plot, possibly doubling its current size. So, get out there and keep things moving. I try to get out once a month and do something, even if it is just going for a walk with a shotgun. Until next
time, shoot straight and tight lines!
